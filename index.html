											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! My name is Kendall Daniels. I am a Professional and Technical Writing major, as well as a Medicine and Society minor. This is my first time coding! However, I have minimal experience in CSS. Some social media websites have customizable themes, and I feel as though it is my duty to make everything purple with a Lantinghei TC font. I also took a photoshop class in middle school, which helps me with creating .png and .jpg files. I have actually messed around with fonts so much that I am able to name the ones that commonly show up on signs and dinner menus. I hope to be able to make websites or blogs that are not only informative, but aesthetically pleasing. </p>

										<h3>Reading Science Articles</h3>
										<p>I often find myself reading about recent scientific discoveries - specifically those that deal with nature and human biology. Since I was little, I have always loved medicine and human anatomy. As a lover of both science and English, Virginia Tech is the perfect school when it comes to the publishing, and reading, of scientific research. Since I may want to be a science writer, digital writing and coding will be a necessity.</p>
									</li>

										<h3>Sorority</h3>
										<p>I am currently a pledge of Delta Gamma Sigma. This year, we are involved in the Boys and Girls Club in Roanoke, Virginia. This non-profit organization provides after school programs for those who cannot afford programs like daycare. It serves as a safe and fun place for children to learn and grow! Digital writing may not be a large component of the sorority life, but if there is a position to work with the official GDS website, I would certainly take it.</p>
									</li>

										<h3>Rockclimbing</h3>
										<p>Athletics has always been an important part of my life. However, until recently, I have been out of the game for a while because of my hectic college schedule. I'm honestly horrified of the gyms on campus, so I would rather work out at a place where it is smaller and more like a community. Crimper's Climbing Gym is the place to be. Rock-climbing is like doing a puzzle with your body, which can be both mentally and physically challenging. I'm pretty sure that digital media won't work its way into rock climbing, but it will be fun to brag about my coding ability with my climbing friends.</p>

							<p>"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day"</p>
