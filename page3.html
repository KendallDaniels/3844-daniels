								<h2>V-Shaped Student</h2>
								<p> I was ecstatic to work on a video because I love visual aesthetics and photography. In the past, I have also worked with programs like iMovie, but that was before the updates made it almost unrecognizable. Our "Mega team" decided to do a parody of "Tasty". Tasty, if you don't know, is kind of like a video version of a cook book. The videos usually last 2 minutes, and is comprised of great cinematography, some cool beats to set the mood, and text overlay in order to describe what the ingredients and measurements are for the recipe. I tackled the task of creating a title card that replaced "Tasty" with "Hokie", as well as finding the song that will softly play in the background.</p>
								<p> We thought that this concept would be great for the V-Shaped student because of the multitude of components that are involved. The V-Shaped student, like the T-Shaped student, has two parts to it. The left and right parts that make up the "V" are informal communal learning and guided experimental learning, respectively. We decided to have an ingredient associated with each component. Informal Community Based Experiential Learning made up the dry ingredients; whereas, Guided Experiential Learning was represented by the wet ingredients. With thoughtful consideration, we decided to assign an activity with an ingredient. For example, we chose chocolate chips to represent Study Abroad because they aren't necessary for the cookie, but they definitely heighten the experience of eating the cookie. Other examples include: Clubs as flour, Community Service as salt, and the Capstone Experience as eggs.</p>
