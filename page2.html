								<h2>The T-Shaped Student</h2>
								<p> I have to admit that I was reluctant to do the podcast at first. I had done a few in the past and they were never really my thing. However, having Kathleen, Rebecca, and Shea as group members really helped to feel comfortable enough to speak into the microphone. The podcast was an interview style that was made to feel more like a game of four square than ping pong. All four of us explained our majors, classes, and how we got to where we are today. By explaining our individual experiences, we hoped for the listeners to understand the concept of the T-Shaped Student. The T-Student, if you recall, is comprised of a top and a bottom. The top or vertical part of the "T" represents transdisciplinary knowledge and technological literacy; whereas, the bottom or vertical part of the "T" symbolizes disciplinary depth. A few of the questions that we proposed to one another were as follows: What is your cross of the T?, How is technology incorporated into your individual major, if you were apprehensive to declare a liberal arts major at a technology-based school, and if your experience as a VT-Shaped student made you feel more well rounded. All of the answers to these questions were meant demonstrate how diverse that the English students are here at Virginia Tech.
								</p>
								<p>Even though our subject matter was both personable and relatable, we missed the mark when it came to creativity. Some groups, for example, created a fake new product; whereas, another made a parody off of Serial. In addition, we didn't create a high quality podcast when it came to sound quality and sound effects. Even though I was in a comfortable group, I was not vocal enough when I saw certain issues that needed to be fixed. I felt as though the group wanted to one-and-done the podcast. We could have looked up some tutorial about how to raise the volume on my audio or how to insert an MP4 file into Audacity. In addition, we could have also worked on our speed and inflection in order to not bore the audience. Even though we lacked in some areas, we excelled in other. Dr. Evia stated that we had some "honest content about [our] experiences across majors. [The podcast was] well-connected to the T-shaped concept". This podcast taught me to speak up when needed, because it really pays off in the long run. I also really bonded with my teammates and I am excited to know that I may see them again in some other English classes.
