									<li>"The intersection of those two ways of thinking—making and knowing—led to some of the most powerfully creative impulses of the Renaissance."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"An artist who trained in the sciences, a scientist whose studies began with the arts: What made Leonardo and Galileo who they were had a great deal to do with how their education demanded that they learn, think, and see outside and across boundaries."</li>
									<br>
									<li>“Universities today have to be thinking … about how we’re going to do and provide education at the undergraduate and graduate level, how we’re going to serve our various constituency groups,” DePauw said. “We need to be thinking more quickly because change is happening so fast. We have to try as hard as we can to be ahead of the curve.”</li>
									<br>
									<li>"Destination areas are voluntary educational paths in which students can take core classes but also pursue cross-disciplinary opportunities, meaning they can concentrate on a unique field while also working toward a more traditional degree, such as engineering or English."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"Emerging from this work is the notion of a “purpose-driven and person-centered” curricular design. A Virginia Tech education will engage the whole person and through inclusive connections contribute to the value of each person and to the groups in which they participate."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"Liberal education involves being able to balance a free range of inquiry alongside the needs and obligations of the community. It is this interplay between inquiry and service that defines Virginia Tech’s Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) model."</li>
									<br>
								  <li>“We want to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the future,” said President Tim Sands. “To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our university’s motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).”</li>
									<br>
									<li>"For our students, the hardest part about inventing the future will be the demands that they will face, exciting but constant, to invent, and then reinvent, themselves in often unimagined futures."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"With this center, we’re aiming for a holistic experience for our students. We want them to be able to take advantage of all the riches available to them, to help them build the careers — and the lives — that will allow them to flourish"</li>
									<br>
								  <li>"The challenges of the future require the capacity to work in interdisciplinary teams, engage in critical and creative thinking, collaborate with diverse people, communicate effectively, and conduct oneself with a deep sense of ethics."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"Today, our problems are larger and more complex than ever. Not all of the solutions to those problems will be technological. Indeed, some of those problems arise from the mistaken belief that technology can ever be separated from the people who use that technology."</li>
									<br>
									<li>“Technology alone is not enough—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”</li>

								<h2>Reflection</h2>
								<p>Education is more than learning a specific subject. One must know how to reinvent themselves as they face real-world problems - problems that can't be found in any textbook. I was interested in the way that history was used to prove the effectiveness of a new model of education. By being reminded of the time period of Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei, I was able to realize that we are experiencing another wave of innovation - which spans across the sciences and the visual arts. This opened my eyes to the idea that I could be just as great as Leonardo or Galileo in my own way. When I first learned what a VT-Shaped Student was, I was in shock. The reason that I was in shock was because I am already, by definition, a VT-Shaped Student. Currently, I am a Professional and Technical Writing (PTW) major, with a minor in Medicine and Society. The reason that I decided to change my major from Biology to PTW was because I wanted a human connection. I was tired of memorization, of being 100% right or 100% wrong, of being a robot. I enjoyed learning all of that information, but I wasn't applying my knowledge to anything. Luckily, Virginia Tech has great advisors, as well as a plethora of majors to fall back on, and I was able to adjust my education to my liking. Since I am now taking English and science classes at the same time, I get to balance my creative and my scientific side - which can be fun; but, it isn't always easy. By being this hybrid student, I can say that yes, I know about scientific theories and human anatomy, but I also know how to code and I know how to connect with others. Education needs a touch of humanity. Yes, we are students, but we are also humans - we have emotions, memories, and experiences. I hope to become a medical professional when I graduate from Virginia Tech and I want to be a more well rounded scientist - who treats her patients like people, not experiments. </p>

								<p>Personally, the most difficult part of HTML has to do with memorizing all of the key words and tags. There are so many abbreviations, quotation marks, and other nonnumeric symbols to be wary of. Luckily, there is a surplus of resources that are availaible to me, so I will never be truly lost. The whole process of learning HTML can be very overwhelming at first; but, I learned that the best way to conquer your fear is to confront it, play with it, and keep practicing. I found myself playing with Atom, our friendly neighborhood code generator, rather than watching TV shows on Netflix. By saving your code and previewing it, you realize that it's really just a lot of trial and error. If you make a mistake (also known as "breaking the internet", in Dr. Evia's words), you can always use Command+Z. Sometimes I wish that I could use the "Undo" button in real life, but that's besides the point. Even though CSS is my favorite part of coding, HTML satisfies the organizational part of me. I can organize my information into headings, bullet points, and numbered lists and that's the best feeling in the world when you are a borderline perfectionist. As someone who regularly tweets, posts, you name it, there is a different level of satisfaction that goes along with writing / coding a website by hand via HTML. For instance, when I post my website, I know that I will be sending my URL to every single friend and family member.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Over the course of Unit 1, I have noticed that there is more to digital writing than meets the eye. Digital writing is more that just typing whatever you want on the internet. We are deviating away from Microsoft Word, and we are leaning towards coding programs - something that I thought only programmers had to deal with. Even though the action of writing a paragraph or two is second nature to me, it's getting your message out there that is the most challenging aspect. There are things like structure, fonts, and spacing - all of which that contribute to how your message will be perceived.</p>

								<h2>Quote</h2>
								<p>The English major reads because, as rich as the one life he has may be, one life is not enough. He reads not to see the world through the eyes of other people but effectively to become other people. What is it like to be John Milton, Jane Austen, Chinua Achebe? What is it like to be them at their best, at the top of their games?” </p>
