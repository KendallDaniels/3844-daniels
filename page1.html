									<li>"The intersection of those two ways of thinking—making and knowing—led to some of the most powerfully creative impulses of the Renaissance."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"An artist who trained in the sciences, a scientist whose studies began with the arts: What made Leonardo and Galileo who they were had a great deal to do with how their education demanded that they learn, think, and see outside and across boundaries."</li>
									<br>
									<li>“Universities today have to be thinking … about how we’re going to do and provide education at the undergraduate and graduate level, how we’re going to serve our various constituency groups,” DePauw said. “We need to be thinking more quickly because change is happening so fast. We have to try as hard as we can to be ahead of the curve.”</li>
									<br>
									<li>"Destination areas are voluntary educational paths in which students can take core classes but also pursue cross-disciplinary opportunities, meaning they can concentrate on a unique field while also working toward a more traditional degree, such as engineering or English."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"Emerging from this work is the notion of a “purpose-driven and person-centered” curricular design. A Virginia Tech education will engage the whole person and through inclusive connections contribute to the value of each person and to the groups in which they participate."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"Liberal education involves being able to balance a free range of inquiry alongside the needs and obligations of the community. It is this interplay between inquiry and service that defines Virginia Tech’s Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) model."</li>
									<br>
								  <li>“We want to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the future,” said President Tim Sands. “To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our university’s motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).”</li>
									<br>
									<li>"For our students, the hardest part about inventing the future will be the demands that they will face, exciting but constant, to invent, and then reinvent, themselves in often unimagined futures."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"With this center, we’re aiming for a holistic experience for our students. We want them to be able to take advantage of all the riches available to them, to help them build the careers — and the lives — that will allow them to flourish"</li>
									<br>
								  <li>"The challenges of the future require the capacity to work in interdisciplinary teams, engage in critical and creative thinking, collaborate with diverse people, communicate effectively, and conduct oneself with a deep sense of ethics."</li>
									<br>
									<li>"Today, our problems are larger and more complex than ever. Not all of the solutions to those problems will be technological. Indeed, some of those problems arise from the mistaken belief that technology can ever be separated from the people who use that technology."</li>
									<br>
									<li>“Technology alone is not enough—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”</li>
									<br>

								<h2>Reflection</h2>
								<p>For me, I was interested in the way that history was used to prove the effectiveness of a new model of education. By bringing up the time period of Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei, I was able to realize that we are experiencing another wave of innovation - innovation which spans across the sciences and the visual arts. This opened my eyes to the idea that I could be just as great as Leonardo or Galileo in my own way. Technology can't exist without humans being involved, much like in lab experiments when one needs to account for human error. Spiller implied that education needs a touch of humanity. Yes, we are students, but we are also humans that have emotions, memories, and experiences. After hearing Spiller talk about this balence, I felt like she was describing my educational path. The reason that I decided to major in Professional and Technical Writing (instead of majoring in Biology) was because I wanted a human connection. I was tired of memorization, of being 100% right or 100% wrong, of being a robot. Since I am now taking english and science classes at the same time, I get to balance my creative and my scientific side - which can be fun; but, it isn't always easy. By being this hybrid student, I can say that yes, I know about theories and human anatomy, but I also know how to code, and I know how to connect with others. I hope to become a medical professional when I graduate from Virginia Tech and I want to be a more well rounded scientist - who treats her patients like people, not experiments. We need to expand our minds past the walls of the classroom and into the neigborhood, the community, and the world. This is what a VT-Shaped Individual education wants to create. </p>
								<p>Personally, the most difficult part of HTML has to do with memorizing all of the key words and tags. There are so many abbreviations, quotation marks, and other nonnumeric symbols to be wary of. Luckily, there is a surplus of resources that are availaible to me, so I will never be truly lost. The whole process of learning HTML can be very overwhelming at first; but, I learned that the best way to conquer your fear is to confront it, play with it, and keep practicing. I found myself playing with Atom, our friendly neighborhood code generator, rather than watching TV shows on Netflix. By saving your code and previewing it, you realize that it's a lot of trial and error. Even though CSS is my favorite part of coding, HTML satisfies the organizational part of me. The fact that I can organize my information into headings, bullet points, and numbered lists really makes me happy. There is a huge amount of satisfaction that I feel when I see that I have managed to get my voice out on the internet. As someone who regularly posts on social media and blogs, writing in HTML and having an entire website that was handmade by me and you me brings my pride to the next level.</p>
								<p>Over the course of Unit 1, I have noticed that there is more to digital writing than meets the eye. Digital writing is more that just typing stuff on the internet. Even though the action of writing a paragraph or two is second nature to me, it's getting your message out there that is the most challenging aspect. We are deviating away from Microsoft Word, and we are leaning towards coding programs - something that I thought only programmers had to deal with. </p>
